# Setup
There are two shell scripts that simplify the installation process.

## Developer script
Run in the platformio ide terminal:
```shell
source install_developer_sdk.sh
```

## Server installation script
This script will install all required dependencies and setup a mysql server + mongodb server.

Run in a regular terminal:
```shell
sudo source install_server.sh
```
